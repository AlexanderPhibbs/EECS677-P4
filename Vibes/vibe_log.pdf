This had more detail than expected but ultimately the implementation failed as soon as i put it on my own machine and tried to run it.
The replit website must have been holding some kind of database that was allowing it work but there were a lot of issues.
I spent a little under an hour trying to get the website to just run to see if all the things were working but it became sort of a rabbit hole
 with one issue leading to another as soon as I fixed the first error.
I would take time to fix the database issue along with verifying that it did all of the other things it was told to do. I had it create 
Security_Documentation to go through the Owasp top 10 and try to explain all the things it did and rate each one with why it added those features.

It is supposed to be run with Make all, I told it to use sqLite as that is what i usually use along with react and node however it seemed to ignore
almost all of my prompts and suggestions and take the easiest route for creating this project, the website preview looked great though!
