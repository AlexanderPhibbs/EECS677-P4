OWASP Top 10 Security Checklist (2021):

Things that I consdered handled from the list.

A01 - Broken Access Control:
   - Ensures users can only perform actions allowed for their role. Admin can delete any post; regular users can only delete their own posts.

A02 - Cryptographic Failures:
   - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt.

A03 - Injection:
   - Used parameterized queries with SQLite to prevent SQL injection.

A07 - Identification and Authentication Failures:
   - Sessions managed with express-session. Password hashing with bcrypt ensures authentication is secure.

A08 - Software and Data Integrity Failures:
   - Verified that frontend code and backend dependencies are from trusted sources.

A10 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):
   - Do not allow backend to make arbitrary HTTP requests based on user input.

Features or different things I could change to make it more secure with more time.

A04 - Insecure Design:
   - I could add rate-limiting, CSRF protection, and input validation to strengthen design.

A05 - Security Misconfiguration:
   - Ensure CORS is configured to allow only the frontend origin and sessions are secured with proper flags.

A06 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components:
   - Keep all Node.js, React, and npm packages up to date. A few packages gave warning flags that they are depreciated.

A09 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures:
   - Implement logging for login attempts, post creation/deletion, and admin actions for auditing purposes.

Most of these things wouldnt be a large overhaul of the program but some minor changes that would only take a few hours to figure out and implement.
For all of the features I belive are secure formal testing would be required to make sure all of these are up to the standards.
